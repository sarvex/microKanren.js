This is my first attempt to work with logic programming in JavaScript 
this works out to be essentially as direct as possible a translation
of Oleg Kiselyov's microKanren from Scheme to JavaScript

original: http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/sokuza-kanren.scm

There are currently some obvious oddities from imperfections in translating
and features of Scheme that really don't match with JavaScript

Currently conso (and therefore all code that rely on conso)
doesn't work as expected in the case of conso(1,lx,[1,2,3])
where lx should be [2,3].

Eitherway it's an okay start for now, and did help me to get a 
better sense of how unification works in microKanren.

Hopefully next up will be a more detailed implementation of miniKanren
and hopefully a mini prolog
